## Code Style

In this project, we adhere to standardized JavaScript coding style conventions to enhance code readability and maintainability. Here are the key aspects of our coding style:

- **Semicolons:** A semicolon is present after each statement.
- **Function Declarations:** All functions are declared above the code that uses them.
- **Variable Naming Conventions:** We follow naming conventions for local variables, utilizing camelCase lettering starting with a lowercase letter.

- **Formatting in Visual Studio Code:**
  - The code is formatted in Visual Studio Code using the Alt + Shift + F command.
  - **Tab Size:** Set to 4 spaces.

These practices contribute to a consistent and organized codebase, making it easier to collaborate and maintain the project.
